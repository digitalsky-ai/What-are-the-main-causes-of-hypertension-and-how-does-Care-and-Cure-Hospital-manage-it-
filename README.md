Hypertension, or high blood pressure, can develop due to factors like unhealthy diet, lack of exercise, obesity, smoking, excessive salt intake, stress, and family history. At Care and Cure Hospital, the management of hypertension begins with an accurate diagnosis through regular blood pressure monitoring and related tests. Doctors then create personalized treatment plans, which may include lifestyle modifications, dietary guidance, stress reduction techniques, and, if necessary, medication. The hospital educates patients about the importance of reducing salt, increasing physical activity, and avoiding tobacco and alcohol. Regular follow-ups help track progress and adjust treatment as needed. By addressing both the causes and the effects of hypertension, Care and Cure Hospital not only helps patients control their blood pressure but also reduces the risk of heart disease, stroke, and kidney damage, ensuring better long-term health outcomes.
